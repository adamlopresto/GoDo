GoDo
====

GoDo is a different kind of todo list for Android. It's designed for scalable
simplicity and context-dependency. Scalable simplicity means that a task can be
as simple (down to just a task name with nothing else) or as complicated (with
multiple due dates, notification options, contexts, repetition rules) as you
want to make it. Context dependency means that GoDo doesn't ever show you a task
if it can know that you can't do it right now.
